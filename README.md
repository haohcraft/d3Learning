[An intro to d3](http://www.samselikoff.com/tutorials/intro-to-d3-big-data.html)

	+ Selection: in D3, the selection has two parts, the representation and the elements on the current DOM
		+ D3 knows the difference of the above two, when the data get joined.
	+ Subselection: there are three subselections: enter, update and exit
	+ Data is stored in the DOM: "when the elements are inserted into the DOM, D3 stores the data properties on the DOM nodes themselves"!
